Veres homework 27.10.2021
Well, I added lab3.c and I think that this code should be checked and improved
This lab was about printing(from min X to max X) an array without number 5 and in the end the count of elements should be printed as well
example
input-> 1 16
output-> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16 => 14
I'm looking forward to your suggestions:)
